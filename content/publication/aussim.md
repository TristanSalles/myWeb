abstract = "In continental environment, sediment mobilisation, dispersion and deposition are mainly controlled by mass gravity and stream-flow processes. Alluvial sedimentary systems have an important economic value because of their capacity to host mineral resources. In the Hamersley Province, alluvial iron deposits (including the well-known Detrital Iron Deposits and Channel Iron Deposits) play an increasing role on the commodity market. Alluvial deposits exploration is challenging and generally involves geomorphologic and stratigraphic field studies, as well as expensive exploratory surface sampling and drilling. We applied a new surface processes modelling technique to investigate iron rich material â€“ i.e. the erosion product of bedded iron formations - dispersion in the Hamersley Province. LECODE is a 3D-parallel surface processes forward modelling code designed to compute surface flow and solve erosion, transport and sedimentation on the geological time scale. The code offers new quantitative ways to better understand how sedimentary deposits develop in intra-continental and channel environments. Here we show that our integrated forward model is capable of opening a window to the construction of sedimentary architectures, including facies distribution, deposit thickness, and development of heterogeneities such as mineral traps over the modelled domain. The model results represent 1 Ma of surface evolution and are validated through comparison to published paleovalleys map and known occurrences of iron ore deposits. This model allows for the first time to track alluvial materials from source to sink through time, test existing geological models and faithfully reproduce the first order distribution of alluvial iron deposits in an area of interest. This technology already demonstrates a strong potential to maximise alluvial iron deposits exploration success, while reducing exploration cost and associated environmental impact."
