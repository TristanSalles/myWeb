abstract = "With increasing concerns about climate change and sea-level rise, there is a need for a comprehensive understanding of the sedimentary processes involved in the erosion, transport and deposition of sediment on the continental shelf. In the present paper, long-term and large-scale seabed morphological changes on the south-west Australian continental shelf were investigated by a comprehensive sediment transport model, Sedsim. The investigated area covers the continental shelf and abyssal basins of the south-western region. The regional seabed is sensitive to environmental forces and sediment supply, and most terrigenous sediment carried down by major rivers is trapped in inland lakes or estuaries. Only a small fraction of fine-grain sediment reaches the continental shelf. The simulation has also confirmed that the Leeuwin Current and high-energy waves play the most important roles in regional long-term seabed evolution. Although the numerical implementation only approximates some forcing and responses, it represents a significant step forward in understanding the nature of potential long-term seabed change as a response to possible climate change scenarios. The 50-year forecast on the seabed morphological changes provides a reference for the management of coastal and offshore resources, as well as infrastructure, in a sustainable way."
