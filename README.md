# Website with goHugo & Wercker

`cd` to local folder:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git push -u origin master
```

To regenerate the websiteâ€™s HTML code when Wercker deployment is not used you will need to run Hugo and upload the public submodule to GitHu

```bash
hugo
cd public
git add .
git commit -m "Build message"
git push -u origin master
```
