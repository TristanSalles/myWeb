abstract = "The margin of the Gulf of Cadiz is swept by an intermediate current the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) flowing from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. On the northern margin of the Gulf (Algarve Margin, South Portugal) the MOW intensity is low, and fine-grained contourite drifts are built up with an alongslope alignment. Recent sedimentological studies emphasize the presence of complex process interactions resulting in the formation of a unique depositional architecture. Alongslope processes related to contour currents generate contourite drift, while downslope processes form canyons and channels aligned on deep faults. This paper uses a combined oceanographic and geological dataset to simulate the different types of interactions between gravity processes and contour currents, which were evidenced on this margin. An extrapolation of the contour current intensity has been used based on the present day velocity field and sea- level fluctuations over the simulated geological time-scale. According to our model results, the construction of the contourite drift is closely linked to contour current velocities and directions, the types of sediments transported and the existing topography. Using modern sedimentological understanding of the area, we have correlated gravity flow's strongest activity to sea level lowstand periods mainly due to a closer connection between canyon's mouth and river or deltaic systems. The simulated gravity flows are initialized at different locations and times on the margin depending on the preserved lobes retrieved from seismic analysis. Their resulting morphological features are identified as perched-lobes with volumes and forms close to the ones observed on Portimao and Lagos Drifts. This study provides a process-based understanding of the construction of contourite system and a physical evaluation of the interactions between gravity flows perpendicular to the slope, and alongslope processes. In addition, it shows the influence of autocyclic factors in the construction of contourite sedimentation, which is important to consider in future sedimentary paleo- reconstruction interpretations."
