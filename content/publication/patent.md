abstract = "The method involves discretizing a topographic surface in a set of cellular automatons. A physical state defined by physical parameters is associated to each automaton, where the parameters characterize materials, flow exchange of materials between current and its environment, and an energy of the current. A stationary physical state is determined for the automaton, and a geological parameter e.g. thickness of deposited sedimentary materials, is determined for the automaton from the stationary state. An architecture of the layers is constructed for the automaton from the geological parameter."
